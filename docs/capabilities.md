## Session Launch

Currently Receiver for Web launches the HTML5 HDX session in a new tab. This API allows HTML5 HDX session to be embedded within a website or to be opened in a new tab.

## HTML5 Receiver Events

HTML5 HDX session provides a set of events for the website to give better control on the session with respect to various connection states, errors and URL redirection. The user experience with the HDX session can be customized using the events.

## UI Customizations

It is possible to leverage the embedding of the session along with the receiver events to achieve some of the UI customizations mentioned below to build preferred experience:

1. Session connection experience
>- Custom connection experience could be built using the various connection events.

2. Error dialog customization

>- Error dialog shown by HTML5 receiver with custom error message: Error messages in the locales folder can be edited which will be picked by error dialog shown by HTML5 receiver.
